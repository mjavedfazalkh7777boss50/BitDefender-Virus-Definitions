## BitDefender-Virus-Definitions 2025

The latest virus definitions for BitDefender Antivirus, BitDefender Antivirus Plus and BitDefender Internet Security, ready to be installed on offline systems.The virus signatures are normally downloaded and installed automatically by the Bitdefender product you own. It is recommended that you allow your Bitdefender product to automatically scan for new definitions and update its database silently. However, manual update is also possible. Nevertheless, there might be situations when your computer gets disconnected from the Internet, and the automatic download is not possible anymore. In this case, you can use the latest BitDefender Virus Definitions package to make sure the virus signatures are up-to-date.
